- Evaluation on toxicity
	- Evaluation on standard benchmark
		- no tuning and RLHF
	- Evaluation on diverse system prompts
		- characteristics of toxicity under different prompts
	- Evaluation on diverse user prompts
		- characteristics of toxicity under different prompts
	- Ideas:
		- relationship between different decoding method and toxicity
		- a criteria to determine which decoding is better from a AI safety perspective
- Evaluation on stereotypes bias
	- Understand the stereotypes from GPT from different perspectives
		- likely
		- type
		- how to increase using prompts 
			- to target
			- non-target
	- Ideas:
		- relationship between different decoding method and bias
		- a criteria to determine which decoding is better from a AI safety perspective
- Evaluation on adversarial robustness
