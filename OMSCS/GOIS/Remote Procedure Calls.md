# Â Interface Definition Language
- What can the server do?
- What arguments are required for the various operations? We need an agreement
- Why 
	- client-side bind decision
	- runtime to automate stub generation
# Specifying an IDL
- An IDL used to describe the interface the server exports:
	- procedure name, arg & results types
	- version  number
- RPC can use IDL that is (only for the interface)
	- language-agnostic
	- language-specific
# Marshalling / Un-marshalling

# Binding and Registry
- Client determines
	- which server should it connect to
	- how will it connect to that server
- Registry == database of available services
	- search for service name to find service (which) and contact details (how)
	- distributed
		- any RPC service can register
	- machine-specific
		- for services running on same machine
		- client must know machine address
			- registry provides port number needed for connection
	- needs naming protocol
		- exact match for "add"
		- or consider "summation","sum","addition"
- Visual metaphor

# Pointers in RPCs
- no pointers 
- serialize pointers; copy referenced ("pointed to") data structure to send buffer
# Handling Partial Failures
- When a client hangs, what is the problem?
	- server down? service down? network down? message lost?
	- timeout and retry => no guarantees!
- special RPC error notification (signal, exception...)
	- catch all possible ways in which the RPC can (partially) fail
# RPC Design Choice Summary
- Binding => how to find the server
- IDL => how to talk to the server; how to package data
- Pointers as arguments => disallow or serialize pointer data
- Partial failures => special error notifications
# What is SunRPC?
