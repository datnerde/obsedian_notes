## Classic Model

### 1. Support Vector Machine
- Where it comes from:![[Pasted image 20230702170546.png]]
- Intuition:
	- Project low dimensional data to high dimensional space so that they can be separates into two groups by a support vector classifier
- Kernel function:
	- Systematically projections to higher dimensional space
	- Radial Kernel (RBF)
	- Polynomial Kernel
	- Kernel Trick:
		- Calculate the relationships between every pair of points as if they are in the higher dimension instead of doing the transformation
