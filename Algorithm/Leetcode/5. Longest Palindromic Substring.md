Given a string `s`, return _the longest palindromic substring_ in `s`.
A string is called a palindrome string if the reverse of that string is the same as the original string.
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
