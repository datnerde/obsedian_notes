- Document based model
	-  target use cases where data comes in self-constrained documents and relationships between one document and another are rare
- Graph model
	-  go in the opposite direction, targeting use cases where anything is potentially related to everything.
## Query Language
-  imperative 
	- tell exactly how to perform certain operation in a certain order.
-  declarative
	-  just specify the pattern
