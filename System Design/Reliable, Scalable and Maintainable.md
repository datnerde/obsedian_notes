# What is a Data Insensitive Application
- An application is data intensive if the amount of data that it generates/uses increases quickly or if the complexity of data that it generates/uses increases quickly or if the speed of change in data increases quickly.

# Reliability
- fault tolerance from human, software or hardware faults.
- The system can ensure there is no unauthorized access to systems, output is as per expectation and performance is good enough for the application to be usable. Deliberately doing Chaos testing helps with finding out issues. 
- Hardware components have faults and thus the design of the system should be such that it can handle full machine failure. 
- Bugs need to be fixed and caught at a much earlier phase and thus system needs to be testable and monitorable. 
- Automating tests and staging/testing environment needs to present. 
- And there needs to be a way to quickly roll-back when failure happens. 
- Reliable systems are the basis of companies revenue, legal compliance and productivity of users of the system.
